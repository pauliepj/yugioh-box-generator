Yu-Gi-Oh! Blind Box Generator

This tool is designed for Yu-Gi-Oh! players who enjoy blind drafting.
While tools such as the YGOPRODeck Cube Generator (https://ygoprodeck.com/cube/
) allow players to create custom cubes, building a cube manually means you already know every card included. This application instead allows you to generate a randomized booster box from an existing set, preserving the surprise and uncertainty of opening packs.

The generator attempts to model realistic rarity distributions based on known box patterns. At present, generation rules are implemented for older sets, with plans to support additional and newer sets in the future.

Usage

This application is distributed as a standalone Windows .exe, allowing anyone to run it without installing Node.js or additional dependencies. You can generate a randomized box from a selected set at any time, exporting the results as a .ydk file for use in supported tools.
